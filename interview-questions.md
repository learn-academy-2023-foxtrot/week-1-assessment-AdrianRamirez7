# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: This is a structure of code that organizes behavior logic and outputs whichever result comes out to be true or false

Researched answer: Controls behavior and determines decisions based on if the code being ran is true or false.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a version control system that monitors what code inside of your files have been changed or uploaded from your local machine. GitHub is software that holds those code changes in a container called a repository. It is also a website that pushes your finished code to production and out to the world for users.

Researched answer: Git is a version control that tracks new code added to your 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: In most cases it would be either the greater than symbol (>), less than symbol (<), or the equality operators strict (===) and loose (==).

Researched answer: The logical OR operator is used to evaluate multiple boolean values that will output true or false.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The array index is the position number that the elements are stored in. In addition, array indexes have their own amount of elements inside their brackest but they are counted in a number order called zero bases indexing. Which means every element inside of the array adds its start count at 0 instead of 1 thats in standard count. The value the specifc data type that each element in the array is known as. Arrays can hold a series of data types including strings, numbers, floats, nulls, and even other array brackets, also known as multi-dimensional arrays.

Researched answer: 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are objects that hold multiple primitive values and encapsulate these values inside a syntax known as brackets. Strings on the other hand, Don't combine their values with other data types. Rather, a strings job is to print some type of human readable text in the program. Strings also don't require any specific syntax like brackets or curly braces to hold their code since they are considered a single data type. Strings only close their values with quotation marks. A similaritie they share are the ability to transform themselves into equal data types using built-in methods, a javascript syntax that modifies the code. For instance, arrays can turn into strings using a .join() method, and a string can turn itself into an array using a .split() method. When combined the right way, they can equal each other.

Researched answer: Both strings and arrays inherit different prototypes and have different instance methods. Strings contain a single variable number of elements, while arrays contain any data type. What makes arrays and strings similar is the methods they share. both can itearted through for loops to log the amount of characters or elements they conatiain. In addition, while both an array and a string are inside of a for loop, they need to have a .length method attacthed to their variable name to ensure both iterations count through the loop.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: In pair programming, partners are individually assigned to be a driver or a navigator. The driver has a listening role, a drivers role is shares their screen with the group and types an instruction that is given to them. The driver is also going to be more of the listener in this role as well. The navigator on the other hand, has a role of vocaly instructing the driver what code solution to type based on the given instructions assigned to their group.

Researched answer: The driver writes the code while the navigator reviews each line of code that the driver is typing. The driver plays the roles of having the ideas of the task at hand and relay those ideas to the driver. They often have to switch roles frequently to take turns.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: HOF take in a function as a argument and returns that function as a result. HOF also work with multiple array built-in methods to return the best possible outcome that the function needs. These include the sort method, filter method, and map method just to name a few. Overall, HOF can help organize our code in smaller chunks, making it easier to maintain and extend.

2. Jest: Jest is a framework that pre-commits hooks that complete a series of test cases. Theses test cases appear inside the terminal in a similar format to the $ git status, green for passing completed code, and red for a failing code. Overall, jest is a great tool to migrate code.

3. Objects: Objects, alongside arrays, are one of the two data types that are not exactly primitive. Objects have a form of collective syntax, meaning they can store mutiple primitive types inside their code block similar to arrays. However, unlike arrays, objects use curly braces to nest their code. Inside an object are two specific properties that the code is always stored in and this is known as "key value pairs." Similar to a variable, the key is the property that holds the value. However, unlike variables, keys dont need an assignment operator to assign a value, instead, they use a colon (:). The value part of an object is the data type assigned to the key. These data types can be primitive.
